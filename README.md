## Problem Statement
**AI-Powered Predictive Analytics for Disease Surveillance & Outbreak Management**

### Key Challenges
- Delayed disease outbreak detection due to manual reporting.
- Lack of real-time health data integration.
- Difficulty forecasting outbreaks and impacts.
- Inefficient resource allocation during outbreaks.
- Limited AI adoption in predictive healthcare analytics.

---

## Solution Approach
HealthGuard addresses these challenges through:
- **Multi-Level Portal System:** Separate portals for State Heads, District Heads, Hospitals, and Users.
- **AI Surveillance and Prediction:** LSTM, ARIMA, Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, and NLP models.
- **Automated Real-Time Alerts:** Outbreak heatmaps, disease trend visualizations, and instant notifications.
- **Resource Optimization Models:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithms for efficient resource allocation.
- **Public Symptom Checker:** AI-based symptom analysis and risk assessment.

---

## Key Features
- **Early Outbreak Detection** with AI trend analysis.
- **Real-Time Case Monitoring** across state and district levels.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation** based on predictive modeling.
- **Public Engagement** through localized alerts and symptom checking.
- **Secure Health Data Management** aligned with HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

---

## System Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts / D3.js / Chart.js.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Node.js (Optional for Microservices).
- **Databases:** MySQL (Structured Data), MongoDB (Unstructured Data).
- **AI/ML Models:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, NLP models (BERT, GPT).
- **Data Sources:** Hospital Portals, Government Health APIs, OpenWeather API.
